KivyMD is a collection of Material Design compliant widgets for use with [Kivy](http://kivy.org), a framework for cross-platform, touch-enabled graphical applications.

The project's goal is to approximate Google's [Material Design spec](https://material.io/design/introduction/) as close as possible without sacrificing ease of use or application performance.
